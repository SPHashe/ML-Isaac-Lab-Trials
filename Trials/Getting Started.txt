Hardest part of learning anything is getting started, so heres a jump start of what to do for a quickstart

# Download the Needed Folder
https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/download.html#isaac-sim-download
Go in the isaacsim website by nvidia and download the folder depending on your device.

# Next Step
Open up CMD with admin premisions, copy the following code and run it:

mkdir C:\isaacsim
cd %USERPROFILE%/Downloads
tar -xvzf "isaac-sim-standalone@4.5.0-rc.36+release.19112.f59b3005.gl.windows-x86_64.release.zip" -C C:\isaacsim
cd C:\isaacsim
post_install.bat
isaac-sim.selector.bat

# Long Wait and Open Program
After a whole bunch of code running on your screen, a Isaacsim full app  will open, select the options you need (and if you dont know then just run with the defaults it worked for me)

# Debugging
I didnt run into any problems after that. This will probably be updated over time as I run into problems. Good luck in your endevours fellow coders.
